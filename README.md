## Description

This repository contains a solution to a test task involving 13-digit numbers in the base-13 system.

### Task

Consider 13-digit numbers in the base-13 system (digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C) with leading zeros.

**Examples**:
- ABA98859978C0
- 6789110551234
- 0000007000000

A number is termed _beautiful_ if the sum of its first six digits is equal to the sum of its last six digits.

**Objective**:
Develop a program that calculates and prints the number of beautiful 13-digit numbers in the base-13 system.

## Solution

The solution uses a combination of dynamic programming and parallel computing concepts to efficiently compute the count of beautiful numbers. The C++20 standard is leveraged for its advanced features and capabilities.

## Usage

Compile the program using a C++20 compliant compiler and run the executable to see the count of beautiful 13-digit numbers.
